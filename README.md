# meetUP
An app created to look for food places on campus based on your schedule, and meet up with friends on break with you.

-----

This app was created for a class I took in Java at UBC. The Java backend work was programmed by myself.

This app was created partly in conjunction with one of my classmates, Kevin Sun. 

The settings tab in the app allows the user to specify types of places to eat/drink at and maximum distance to travel.

NOTE:*** The app functionality depends partly on a JSON file held in one of UBC cs's directories. If this directory has been
changed or removed, certain app functionality will be disabled (schedule, mainly).
